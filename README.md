## About Me
---
My name is Matt Escalante, and I'm a 28 year old software engineer from Michigan. Although I don't have a ton of work posted on my profile, I've actually been in the industry for about 7 years, and I graduated from Grand Valley State University back in 2017 with a bacholor's in information systems and a minor in business. My first development job taught me quite a bit when it comes to writing readable, scalable code, and my second job quite honestly pulled me away from the development world far more than I would have liked for longer than I ever should have allowed. Over the last year or so, I've been taking some courses on Udemy, working on some personal projects, exploring open-source projects here on GitHub, grinding LeetCode, and listening to relevant podcasts (shoutout to Syntax, great stuff). I'd say at this point I'm exploring the whole stack indiscriminately, focusing on different sections depending on the project I'm working on and whatever I feel needs brushing up.
