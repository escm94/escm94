# Hey, folks! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
My name is Matt Escalante, and I'm a 28 year old software engineer from Michigan. Although I don't have a ton of work posted on my profile, I've actually been in the industry for about 7 years, and I graduated from Grand Valley State University back in 2017 with a bacholor's in information systems and a minor in business. While in many ways I really enjoyed working for my most recent employer, the position itself quite honestly pulled me away from the development world far more than I would have liked for longer than I probably should have allowed. Over the last couple of years, I've been taking some courses on Udemy, working on personal projects, exploring open-source projects here on GitHub, grinding LeetCode, and listening to relevant podcasts (shoutout to Syntax, great stuff). I'd say at this point I'm exploring the whole stack indiscriminately, focusing on different sections depending on the project I'm working on and whatever I feel needs brushing up.
